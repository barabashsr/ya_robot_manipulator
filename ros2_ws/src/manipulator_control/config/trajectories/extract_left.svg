  YZ Trajectory Curve for Box Extraction/Insertion

  COORDINATE SYSTEM (unitless - scaling defined in trajectory_config.yaml):
  - X axis (0-100): Maps to joint Y (gripper depth into cabinet)
  - Y axis (center=50): Deviation from 50 maps to joint Z offset
    - z_scale=0.001 means 1 SVG unit = 1mm
    - Y=30 means Z offset = (50-30)*0.001 = +20mm (lift up)
    - Y=70 means Z offset = (50-70)*0.001 = -20mm (dip down)

  SINGLE TRAJECTORY STRATEGY:
  - Same path used for both insertion and extraction (reversed at runtime)
  - Profile: Lift UP in the middle for clearance
  - Insertion: Follow path forward (0 → 100), enter with lift to clear shelf lip
  - Extraction: Follow path reversed (100 → 0), exit with lift to clear box from shelf

  The lift profile works for both directions:
  - Going IN: Lifts over any shelf lip/obstruction
  - Coming OUT: Lifts box clear of shelf before retracting
