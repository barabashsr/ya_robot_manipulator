  YZ Trajectory Curves for Box Extraction/Insertion

  COORDINATE SYSTEM (unitless - scaling defined in trajectory_config.yaml):
  - X axis (0-100): Maps to joint Y (gripper depth into cabinet)
  - Y axis (center=50): Deviation from 50 maps to joint Z offset
    - z_scale=0.001 means 1 SVG unit = 1mm
    - Y=30 means Z offset = (50-30)*0.001 = +20mm (lift up)
    - Y=70 means Z offset = (50-70)*0.001 = -20mm (dip down)

  PATH NAMING:
  - insertion: Gripper moves INTO cabinet (X: 0 → 100)
  - extraction: Gripper retracts WITH box (X: 100 → 0)

  CLEARANCE STRATEGY:
  - Insertion: Start level, dip DOWN slightly mid-path to clear lip, end level
  - Extraction: Start level, lift UP mid-path for box clearance, end level
