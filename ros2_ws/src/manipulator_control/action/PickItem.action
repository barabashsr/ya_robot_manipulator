string message              # Human-readable result message (success/error details)

# Feedback: Published periodically during execution

bool picker_jaw_opened      # True if picker jaw is opened
bool picker_jaw_extended    # True if picker jaw is extended
bool picker_jaw_closed      # True if picker jaw has closed (limit switch triggered)
bool picker_jaw_retracted   # True if picker jaw is retracted
float64 elapsed_time        # Time elapsed since start (seconds)
