# Result: Final state after navigation completes
bool success                    # True if manipulator reached address within tolerance

string message                  # Human-readable result message (success/error details)

# Feedback: Published periodically during execution
geometry_msgs/Point current_position  # Current end effector position [x, y, z] in world frame from TF
float64 distance_to_target      # Current distance from target in meters
uint8 progress_percent          # Completion percentage (0-100)
